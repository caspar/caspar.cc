**"èŠ±"** - 3D printed flower (with chinese "flower" character). I originally made this as a thank you gift for one of my Chinese professors at NYU.

**caspar.cc** - site logo vinyl bike decal for my Brompton. I made a decal that says "personal mobility device" for the other side so I can get it onto airplanes :)

</div>

**phone jig** - I made these iphone jigs for a friend's custom phone case printing project. I said he should post up in front of the SoHo Apple store on a nice day and sell them. You wouldn't even need a vendor's license if you sold them as artworks.

</div>

**"smarticus"** - aftermarket smart fridge product. This module sits in your fridge's door and keeps a list of its contents by reading the barcode of everything you put in and take out of your fridge. The biggest challenge is powering it.
