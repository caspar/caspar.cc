</div>

**personal heatmap** - Google logs my location continuously through the Maps app on my phone. I downloaded my location history from Google, and plotted it using Python and the Google Maps API. (These are my movements around New York City from 2015-2019.)

**"smarticus"** - an aftermarket smart fridge product that's still in the pipeline. This module sits in your fridge's door and keeps a list of its contents by reading the barcode of everything you put in and take out of your fridge. The biggest design challenge is keeping it powered.
