In 2018, I won a $10,000 [Green Grant](https://www.nyu.edu/life/sustainability/get-involved/green-grants.html) from the NYU Office of Sustainability to design and deploy an air quality monitoring network for NYU Shanghai. I modified a design open-sourced by the U.N. Environmental Programme to give my monitors wifi- and remote-access capabilites. Half a year into the project, I took on the role as a project leader at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering for the Smart Cities IoT Sensors Group, a team of six. The project has been featured on NYU's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nyutandon/status/1172201645733797888), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/casparlant_nyu-activity-6577974547553755136-glLZ) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/casparlant/posts/10220422089001717) pages, as well as in an [article](https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/summer-internships-provide-students-career-enhancing-opportunities?fbclid=IwAR3tn3-nOPaOFZoPS41lPyfxWHvmeBC8G2EmWCXfmqIUSTXtF68cnr2YJk4) published by Tandon that I was featured in.

We developed a web data-dashboard that displays live air quality information directly from the sensors I deployed in Shanghai in August 2019. You can find it at [airquality.engineering.nyu.edu](http://airquality.engineering.nyu.edu/). The site is broadcasted continuously to two displays in the the NYU Shanghai campus in an effort to raise awareness about local air quality. The site updates every five seconds with measurements of particulate matter, climate, and greenhouse gases. We also display the live AQI (a more legible measure of air quality).

Currently, our team is working with the U.N. and the University of Nairobi to help them get set up with the web framework we developed for their own monitors.
